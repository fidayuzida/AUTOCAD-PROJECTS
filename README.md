# 🧱 AutoCAD Projects – 3D & 2D Design Collection

This repository showcases my 2D and 3D design projects created using **AutoCAD**.  
The collection includes mechanical components, electrical layouts, and product design exercises completed during my study at **Telkom University (D3 Telecommunication Technology)**.

## 📘 About
All models were built from scratch as part of academic assignments and self-learning projects.  
Each folder contains the original `.dwg` file, rendered preview image, and a brief documentation (`README.md`).  
The goal of this repository is to demonstrate my understanding of **technical drawing, 3D modeling, and engineering visualization**.
